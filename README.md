Real-time Face Detection using OpenCV and dlib
This Python script demonstrates real-time face detection through a webcam feed using OpenCV and dlib libraries.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)
dlib (pip install dlib)
Numpy (pip install numpy)
How to Use
Clone or download the script (face_detection.py).
Ensure all dependencies are installed (OpenCV, dlib, Numpy).
Run the script in a Python environment.
Usage
Execute the script in a Python environment.
The webcam will activate, and the program will begin detecting faces in real-time.
Detected faces will be enclosed within green rectangles on the video feed.
The terminal/console will display the coordinates of each detected face and its index.
Controls
Press 'q' to exit the program.
Important Notes
Ensure your webcam is connected and functional.
The script detects faces in real-time and annotates each detected face with a green rectangle.
Experiment with lighting conditions and face angles for optimal detection performance.

<h1>Real-time Face Detection using OpenCV and dlib</h1>
This Python script demonstrates real-time face detection through a webcam feed using OpenCV and dlib libraries.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

Python 3.x
OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)
dlib (pip install dlib)
Numpy (pip install numpy)


<h2>How to Use</h2>

Clone or download the script (face_detection.py).
Ensure all dependencies are installed (OpenCV, dlib, Numpy).
Run the script in a Python environment.


<h2>Usage</h2>

Execute the script in a Python environment.
The webcam will activate, and the program will begin detecting faces in real-time.
Detected faces will be enclosed within green rectangles on the video feed.
The terminal/console will display the coordinates of each detected face and its index.
Controls

Press 'q' to exit the program.

<h2>Important Notes</h2>

Ensure your webcam is connected and functional.
The script detects faces in real-time and annotates each detected face with a green rectangle.
Experiment with lighting conditions and face angles for optimal detection performance.
